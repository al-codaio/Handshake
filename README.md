`docs > architecture.md` for technical details

# To Add Contracts, as of 29/09/2017

1. Run testrpc

2. In a separate terminal, navigate to project directory and run `truffle migrate --reset`

3. In project directory, copy all files from 'build/contracts' to 'src/contracts'

4. In the project directory terminal, run `npm run start-dev`

5. Navigate to create contract page, enter some text and hit create, navigate back to dash. If all went to plan, that contract will appear in table on the dashboard and has successfully been created on your private blockchain :)
